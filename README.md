## Warbler

Warbler is a Twitter clone using Flask as the technology framework and Python as the language. The site is live hosted at [pizza warbler](https://pizzawarbler.herokuapp.com/).

Pizza Warbler allows the user to register and participate in the community. The user can follow/unfollow another user, and like/dislike other users' warbles.

This website is one of the [Rithm School](https://www.rithmschool.com/) multi-day sprint exercises. Please feel free to sign up a new account, or use the following test account. **username:** testaccount **password:** testaccount

My pair and I specifically worked on:

* Logout route
* User profile page details (location, bio, header image, total liked warbles)
* User cards that appear on followers, following and list-users pages
* User profile edit authentication and update form
* Homepage warbles
* Warble like/dislike button
* Tests for user model, user views, message model, message views
